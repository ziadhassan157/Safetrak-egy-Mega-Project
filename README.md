# Automated-Content-Generation-DEPI-Project
The Automated Content Generation System will create a pipeline that uses generative models (such as GPT or GANs) to automatically generate content. The system will be trained on a specific dataset, fine-tuned using advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms, and integrated into an automated pipeline.
